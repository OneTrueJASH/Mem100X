# Contributing to Mem100x

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Mem100x! We're building the FASTEST MCP memory server, and your help can make it even better.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Found a performance issue? Let us know!

1. Check if the issue already exists
2. Create a new issue with:
   - Clear title describing the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - **Performance metrics** (very important!)
   - Your environment details

### Suggesting Enhancements

Have an idea to make Mem100x even faster? We're all ears!

1. Check if it's already suggested
2. Create an issue with:
   - Clear description of the enhancement
   - Why it would be useful
   - **Performance impact analysis**
   - Possible implementation approach

### Pull Requests

Ready to contribute code? Awesome!

#### Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mem100x.git
cd mem100x

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature
```

#### Development Guidelines

1. **Performance First**: Every change must maintain or improve performance
2. **TypeScript Strict**: All code must pass strict type checking
3. **Performance Focus**: Ensure changes don't degrade performance
4. **Small Functions**: Keep functions under 50 lines
5. **Clear Names**: Use descriptive variable and function names

#### Before Submitting

```bash
# Run type checking
npm run build

# Ensure the code compiles without errors
# Performance standards must be maintained
```

#### PR Requirements

- [ ] Passes all TypeScript checks
- [ ] Performance impact has been considered
- [ ] Performance is maintained or improved
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Commit messages are clear

### Performance Standards

Any PR must meet these standards:

- Entity creation: > 60,000/sec
- Search time: < 2ms
- No memory leaks
- Cache hit rate: > 95% when applicable

### Quality Assurance

Every change must:

1. Compile successfully with TypeScript strict mode
2. Maintain performance standards
3. Work with both single and multi-context modes
4. Include appropriate error handling

## Priority Areas

We especially welcome contributions in:

1. **Performance Optimizations**: Make it even faster!
2. **New Storage Backends**: Redis? PostgreSQL?
3. **Benchmarks**: More comprehensive testing
4. **Documentation**: Examples, tutorials, guides
5. **Tooling**: VS Code extension? CLI tools?

## Code Style

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Keep lines under 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

Example:

```typescript
/**
 * Searches entities with blazing speed
 * @param query - Search query
 * @param limit - Maximum results (default: 20)
 * @returns Matching entities and relations
 */
searchNodes(query: string, limit: number = 20): GraphResult {
  // Implementation
}
```
