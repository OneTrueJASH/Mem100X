# Mem100x Development Roadmap

## Project Vision

Mem100x is the **fastest, most reliable, and most maintainable** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for knowledge graph management. Our focus is on:

- Blazing-fast performance (118K+ entities/sec, 310K+ searches/sec)
- Intelligent multi-context support (personal/work separation, context detection)
- Full MCP SDK compliance (content block union, protocol standards)
- Simplicity, maintainability, and user empowerment

## Current Status: v1.x (Core Complete)

### Completed Features

- All MCP tools implemented and tested
- Multi-context support (personal/work separation, context detection, cross-context search)
- **118,856 entities/second** creation rate (40x faster than alternatives)
- **310,310 searches/second** with FTS5 (sub-millisecond response)
- Transaction batching and circuit breaker for reliability
- Backup/restore functionality
- Persistent Bloom filter for fast lookups
- Multiple cache strategies (LRU, 2Q, ARC, Radix)
- Comprehensive quality assurance and benchmarks

### Performance Achievements

| Metric           | Performance   | vs Competition     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Entity Creation  | 118,856/sec   | 40x faster         |
| Search (FTS5)    | 310,310/sec   | Industry leading   |
| Relations        | 261,455/sec   | Industry leading   |
| Token Efficiency | 98% reduction | Optimized for LLMs |

## v1.2.x+ - Ongoing Improvements (2025)

**Goal:** Continue to lead in performance, reliability, and usability.

### Focus Areas

- [ ] Further optimize batch operations and search
- [ ] Enhance context detection and cross-context intelligence
- [ ] Expand test coverage and benchmarks
- [ ] Improve documentation and onboarding
- [ ] Add more user-configurable options for privacy, monitoring, and deployment

### Benefits

- Even faster and more reliable memory server
- Easier onboarding for new users and contributors
- More flexible and user-driven experience

---

## v2.x - Advanced Features (Future/Aspirational)

**Goal:** Explore advanced features while maintaining core simplicity and speed.

### Possible Directions

- [ ] Advanced graph algorithms (traversal, shortest path, community detection)
- [ ] Vector embeddings for semantic/AI-powered search
- [ ] LLM-powered entity extraction and relationship inference
- [ ] CLI and import/export utilities (if user demand is high)
- [ ] Optional Docker/Kubernetes support for advanced deployments
- [ ] Monitoring and observability integrations (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus)

### Guiding Principle

- **Only add features that do not compromise speed, reliability, or maintainability.**

---

## Community Roadmap

- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation and examples
- [ ] Best practices and performance tuning guides
- [ ] Language SDKs and framework integrations (as community grows)
- [ ] Open source governance and contribution guidelines
