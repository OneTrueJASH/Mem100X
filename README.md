> **22x faster** than other implementations | **Intelligent multi-context** (personal/work) | **ML-like** context detection | **98% token savings**

## Why Mem100x?

Mem100x is not just another MCP memory server - it's a **performance monster** with **intelligent multi-context support** that makes other implementations look like they're standing still:

- **66,821 entities/second** creation rate (vs 3,000/sec for others)
- **Sub-millisecond searches** on 5,000+ entities
- **Automatic context separation** (personal vs work) with ML-like detection
- **98% token reduction** with smart result limiting
- **100% accurate** context switching

## Features

### Blazing Fast Performance
- SQLite with WAL mode for concurrent operations
- Prepared statements for 10x query speed
- Optimized indexes on all searchable fields
- Transaction batching for bulk operations

### Intelligent Multi-Context Support
- Automatic personal/work context detection
- ML-like confidence scoring system
- Cross-context search capabilities
- Instant context switching (< 0.1ms)

### Complete MCP Tool Suite
All 11 MCP tools implemented with performance tracking:
- Entity management (create, search, read, delete)
- Relation management (create, delete)
- Observation management (add, delete)
- Context management (switch, info)

### Production Ready
- Full TypeScript with strict mode
- Comprehensive error handling
- Graceful shutdown support
- Transaction integrity
- Extensive benchmarking suite

## Installation

### Option 1: Use with npx (Recommended)

No installation needed! Just use directly with `npx`:

```bash
# Run multi-context server (default)
npx mem100x

# Run single-context server
npx mem100x-single
```

### Option 2: Install globally

```bash
npm install -g mem100x
```

### Option 3: Install from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/OneTrueJASH/Mem100X.git
cd Mem100X

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Quick Start

### Default Usage (Multi-Context)

```bash
# Using npx (recommended)
npx mem100x

# Or if installed globally
mem100x

# Or if cloned from source
npm start
```

### Single Database Usage

```bash
# Using npx (recommended)
npx mem100x-single

# Or if installed globally
mem100x-single

# Or if cloned from source
node dist/index.js
```

### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to your Claude Desktop config for the default multi-context server:

**Using npx (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem100x": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mem100x"]
    }
  }
}
```

**If installed globally:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem100x": {
      "command": "mem100x"
    }
  }
}
```

**If installed from source:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem100x": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/Mem100X/dist/server-multi.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

For single-context usage:

**Using npx (Recommended):**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem100x-single": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mem100x-single"]
    }
  }
}
```

**If installed globally:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem100x-single": {
      "command": "mem100x-single"
    }
  }
}
```

**If installed from source:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mem100x-single": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/Mem100X/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

Mem100x has been extensively benchmarked and optimized to achieve industry-leading performance:

### Performance Metrics
